#Capstone Blog Started, GitHub Pages, Jekyll, Hugo, and What Came Before

This is the fastest way I can think of explaining how I got here.

1. I've started work on my Capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certification through Coursera and I needed somewhere to keep a blog documenting the work.
2. I find out that you can host a blog on GitHub.
3. Doing stuff on GitHub gives me GitHub experience and a way to show some of my technical skills.
4. Time to figure out how to create a blog on GitHub

##Creating a GitHub blog

Initially AI pointed me toward installing Ruby and Jekyll, which I did but it seemed awfully complicated and I'm not expecting to use Ruby much. I also found a lot of tutorials and videos were done by people running Mac. I'm on Windows. 

###Using a Fork to create my first blog
Looking at a few more videos and I found, [Frontend Tutorials: How to create and host a blog on Github](https://youtu.be/nTLzLhFG9mc?si=0mrwfrmzm-YLJRKs). I watched most of the video and then went back to 1:15 to create my first blog. As I write this sentence, I'm at 5:30 and it's time to commit my changes and try to install Hugo.   

###Make it look nice using Hugo
