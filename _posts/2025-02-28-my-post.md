# Capstone Blog Started, GitHub Pages, Jekyll and Hugo

This is the fastest way I can think of explaining how I got here.

1. I've started work on my Capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certification through Coursera and I needed somewhere to keep a blog documenting my work.
2. I find out that you can host a blog on GitHub.
3. Doing stuff on GitHub gives me more GitHub experience and a way to show more of my technical skills.
4. Time to figure out how to create a blog on GitHub

## Creating a GitHub blog

Initially AI pointed me toward installing Ruby and Jekyll, which I did but it seemed things were getting complicated and I'm not expecting to use Ruby much. I also found a lot of tutorials and videos were done by people running Mac. I'm currently on Windows. Today, a Mac would have made things easier.

### Using a Fork to create my first blog
Looking at a few more videos and I found, [Frontend Tutorials: How to create and host a blog on Github](https://youtu.be/nTLzLhFG9mc?si=0mrwfrmzm-YLJRKs). I watched most of the video and then went back to 1:15 to create my first blog. As I write this sentence, I'm at 5:30 and it's time to commit my changes and try to install Hugo.   

### Make it look nice using Hugo

Well, now I've used Chocolatey to install something (Hugo) from the PowerShell, installed GitHub Desktop, and in PowerShell and Visual Studio installed Hugo into the clone of my GitHub Hugo repository. I'm going to have a lot to add to [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enordstr/) by the end of this. 

**Note**: It would have been easier to find some cheap web hosting that offers blog functionality. I'm going through all of this because I find it interesting and I want to be able to show potential employers that I can figure out stuff like this. Getting interested, figuring out and using new knowldege to create something valuable is something that has made me unique as a technical writer, manager, and almost everything else in my career. But most of what I've done in the past is locked behind firewalls on intranets, where potential employers can't access them. This is a way to show what what I enjoy doing and the value of the results.
